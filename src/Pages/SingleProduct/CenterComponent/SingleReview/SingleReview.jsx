            I recently purchased the KSAN 120 inch video projector screen and I must say, it is the perfect accessory for my projector. The upgraded 3-layer premium polyester material is thicker than other screens on the market, and the special light-shielding layer makes the picture more vivid and clear. I was impressed by the anti-crease feature as there were no obvious creases left after it fully expanded.

What's great about this projector screen is that it's lightweight and portable. It's easy to fold and carry in any shape, making it perfect for both indoor and outdoor activities. The setup process was hassle-free and the ropes and other accessories inside the package made it easy to install.

I have used the KSAN foldable projector screen for home theater, parties, playing games, sports, and sharing in the classroom or meeting room. The only downside is that it does not support double-sided projection due to the light-shielding layer. This projector screen was very easy to use. It’s is very durable and doesn’t not wrinkle, and that was a feature that I definitely needed.
